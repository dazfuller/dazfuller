### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I spend most of my time building data platforms in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) and processing data with [Databricks](https://databricks.com/). When I'm not I seem to spend a lot of time <s>doing battle</s> working with Excel to get data out of it's slippery clutches!

In an effort to become less dependent on services owned by Microsoft (or hosted in the U.S.) I'm more likely to be found either over on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/dazfuller) or on my local [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) server.

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

Electronics. I sucked at it back at school but really want to create some cool stuff with the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and the [BBC Micro:bit](https://microbit.org/), and pretty much anything else I can get my hands on. So far and so good.

Currently learning, pretty much whatever I need to so that I can get the job done.

#### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...

Anything Azure, Databricks, or related to any of the repos.
