### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I spend most of my time building data platforms in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) and processing data with [Databricks](https://databricks.com/). When I'm not I seem to spend a lot of time <s>doing battle</s> working with Excel to get data out of it's slippery clutches!

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

Electronics. I sucked at it back at school but really want to create some cool stuff with the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and the [BBC Micro:bit](https://microbit.org/). So far and so good.

Also wanting to spend some time getting to grips with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I spent years writing code in C++ and still love doing low level stuff and writing command line tools, so want to use something which gives the performance with safety.

#### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...

Anything Azure, Databricks, or related to any of the repos.

#### ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
